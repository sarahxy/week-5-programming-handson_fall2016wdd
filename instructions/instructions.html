				<div class="body-header">Purpose</div>
				<!-- CONTENT -->
				
				<!-- Styled Tags; P, UL, LI, .caption, A, IMG-->
				<!-- Add P Tags for each paragraph -->
				<!-- Use UL LI Tags for each lists -->
				<!-- Use P Tags with "caption" class for paragraph captions (60% opacity) -->
				<!-- Use IMG Tags for assets/images -->
				<p>The goal of this handson is to build on a few past concepts, while building familiarity with CSS positioning and z-indexes.</p>
				<p>At the end of this hands-on, you should have something like this:</p>
				<img src="assets/images/example.png">
				<br>
				<br>
				<div class="body-header">Assignment</div>
				<p>Open up your the HTML and CSS in the starter-files folder. Observe how the divs in the HTML file are structured, and which classes you can work with in the CSS. Some things to keep in mind as you get started:
				<ul>
					<li>You will want to primarily use <b>position: absolute;</b> and <b>position: relative;</b> (maybe even <b>position: fixed;</b>) with the <b>top</b>, <b>bottom</b>, <b>left</b>, and <b>right</b> properties in order to position items.</li>
					<li>We want the table to be positioned on the very bottom of the page, and to be behind all the elements.</li>
					<li>As observed in the picture, we want certain elements to be more in the foreground and other elements (like the vase of flowers) to be more in the background, based on our depth perception and the elements' relative sizes.</li>
					<li>Is there an easy way to get the utensils and plate of food to line up next to each other?</li>
					<li>A suggestion: sometimes it helps to outline your divs (especially container divs) to see how other divs are positioned relative to these divs!</li>
				</ul>
				Remember: the default positioning for all items is <b>static</b>, and static items cannot be moved with the <b>top</b>, <b>bottom</b>, <b>left</b>, and <b>right</b> properties.</p>
				<p>Good luck!</p>
				<div class="body-header">Finishing Thoughts</div>
				<p>Note that there are many different solutions in how you can achieve the same positioning result; so when you're finished, go back and see if there are simpler ways to position the elements without writing a lot of code!</p>
				<p>When you're finished, take a look at the solutions file and compare your answers. You should now hopefully have a better conceptual knowledge on how to position items on a page!</p>
